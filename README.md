# Pixel Violet
This is the first project in which I decided to use JavaScript - specifically, the first one I am making publicly available. I opted for a style inspired by Undertale, enhanced with a more striking color palette. The combination of purple tones and pixel art proved to be a perfect match. The website was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This time it is not Landing page, but portfolio opensource.
